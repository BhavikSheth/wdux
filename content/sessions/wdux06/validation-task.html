<ul>
    <li>Validate each of your pages and fix any errors you find (remember to add a DOCTYPE and Character Encoding - see the slides)</li>
    <li><em>Fix the first error in the list</em> and then re-validate and fix the next</li>
    <li>The <a href="https://validator.w3.org/docs/errors.html" target="_blank">online help for the validator</a> can help explain the messages</li>
    <li>You might need to continue this some other time if you have lots of errors!</li>
</ul>
