<ul>
  <li>Read the suggested CSS tutorials until you understand stylesheets!</li>
  <li>Re-engineer all the pages you've created so far so that they use CSS for formatting</li>
  <li>Try using the margin and padding properties on different elements (especially instead of <tt>&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</tt> and multiple <tt>&lt;br&gt;</tt>s)</li>
  <li>(We'll cover CSS-based positioning in the next session)</li>
</ul
