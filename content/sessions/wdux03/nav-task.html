<ul>
  <li>Use CSS to create a list-based nav bar that links to all of the pages you've created so far on the course</li>
  <li>Use <a href="http://css.maxdesign.com.au/listamatic/" target="_blank">Listamatic</a> if you want</li>
  <li>Put the same nav bar on all the pages you've created so far</li>
  <li>Make all the pages as consistent as possible</li>
  <li>Navigation between each page should be easy</li>
  <li>There should be no deadends</li>
</ul
